# cee-basic-chat-app

This is my simple Socket.io implementation of a simple Chat application. The tutorial that I consulted can be found in the [Socket.io website](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/) 

After completion the app should have at least the following functionalities:
- Have the basic real-time chat functionality
- Add username/nicknames
- Send message when someone connects/disconnects
- Show online users
- Add a user is typing... message
- Refactor code for future use
